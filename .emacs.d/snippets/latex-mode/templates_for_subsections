\subsection{Equivalences}

\subsection{Subtypes}
% eg. a "subring" is a subtype of a "ring"
% eg. a "Noetherian ring" is a subtype of a "ring"
% noneg. "ideal" is not a subtype but a derivative of a "ring"
% eg: "every ideal of R is finitely generated" is an implication
% eg: "R is Noetherian" is a subtyping

\subsection{Examples}
% CONCRETE sufficiencies
% non-eg: Artinian rings are Noetherian rings but Artinian rings are not 
% examples of Noetherian rings
% eg: Z is a ring and Z is a concrete object not an abstract class

\subsection{Stabilities}
% if the type is preserved after certain operation, it is stable
% in the opposite direction, a result of an operation derives a property
% on the original object, is also considered as the result on stability

\subsection{Implications}
% implication that is not subtyped propositions.
% eg: "every ideal of R is finitely generated" is an implication
% eg: "R is Noetherian" is a subtyping

\subsection{Derivatives}
% These are types that are derived but not of the subtype
% eg. "ideal" is a derivative of "ring" because an ideal is a module
% non-eg. a "subring" is not a derivative of "ring" but is its subtype
% non-eg. a "Noetherian ring" is not a derivative of a "ring" but a subtype

\subsection{Supertypes}
% "if A, then B:>C" means that C is a supertype of B

\subsection{Temp}
